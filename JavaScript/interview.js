// And coding questions:
// Output for below snippets
// 1)

// for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
// setTimeout(function () {
// console.log(i);
// }, i * 1200);
// }

// 2)

// let count=0;
// (function jscheck() {
//     console.log(count);
//     if(count == 0) {
//         var count =100;
//     }
//     console.log(count);
// })();
// 3) swapping of 2 variables without third variable
// 4) length of longest substring without repeating charecter.
// 5) API call using fetch method and if there is any rejection how can we handle and retrigger the call and how many times(in particular time interval) even if traffic occur on the server.
