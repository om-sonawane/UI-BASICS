    Assignment Task: Show/Hide Password Using Mouse Events
    <!-- Question:

Create a simple password input field with a button (or icon) next to it that allows users to temporarily view their password by pressing and holding the button with the mouse.

🔧 Requirements:

Use an <input type="password"> element for the password.


Add a button (e.g., labeled "👁️" or "Show") next to the password field.


When the user presses and holds the button using the mouse (mousedown), the password should become visible (type="text").


When the user releases the mouse button (mouseup) or moves the mouse away from the button (mouseleave), the password should be hidden again (type="password").


Style the form neatly using basic CSS for better appearance. -->
